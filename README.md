This is a React App with Material-ui forms designed to collect data needed for getting shipping rates. It uses express server and utilizes the easypost API service to get real time shipping rates for supported carriers (USPS and UPS etc). 

** Next Update: build out functionality for carrier toggles. Need to pass in carrier account ID's to limit rates to only those the user wishes to see. Will need to use enviromental variables to obscur carrier ID's from users.
